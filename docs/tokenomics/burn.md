ShotSpec Token Burn Model  
Deflation Mechanics Across CLUB-Native, Fiat-Cost, and Reward Flows

The ShotSpec ecosystem uses a structured deflation model to ensure long-term token value, sustainability, and DAO-governed monetary control. All burn operations are transparent and verifiable on-chain.

Purpose of the Burn System

The burn model serves the following functions:

• Reduce CLUB circulating supply as usage increases  
• Create long-term scarcity  
• Reward stakers and early adopters via reduced inflation  
• Allow DAO governance to tighten or loosen emissions as needed  
• Incentivize real-world usage of ShotSpec devices and apps

Burn Categories

The protocol burns CLUB in four primary contexts:

1. CLUB-native product purchases
2. Fiat-cost product purchases paid with CLUB
3. Reward pool anti-gaming deductions
4. Governance-directed discretionary burns

Burn Percentages

CLUB-native product purchases:
• 20% of incoming CLUB is burned  
• 80% goes to treasury for development and liquidity

Fiat-cost product purchases paid in CLUB:
• 20% of CLUB burned before or after swap  
• 80% swapped to USDC via Jupiter and used for USD settlement

Anti-cheat automatic deductions:
• Anywhere from 5% to 100% depending on violation severity  
• Tokens sent to a protocol burn address

DAO discretionary burns:
• DAO may burn treasury CLUB to manage long-term emissions  
• Used when CLUB velocity grows faster than model predictions

---

Burn Execution

All burns take place using the standard SPL Token Program “Burn” instruction or by sending CLUB to a provable burn address controlled by no private keys.

Future Enhancements

• DAO-adjustable burn percentages  
• Burn multiplier events during ecosystem milestones  
• On-chain proof-of-burn dashboard
