ShotSpec DAO Governance  
Token-Weighted, Time-Locked Voting for Long-Term Stability

The ShotSpec DAO governs token economics, hardware policies, reward pools, and partnerships with courses. Governance is designed around stake-weighted voting with lock-duration multipliers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Voting Power Model

Voting power = tokens staked × lock-duration multiplier

Example multipliers:
• 1 month lock = 1.0×  
• 6 months = 1.5×  
• 1 year = 2.0×  
• 3 years = 3.0×  
• 5 years = 5.0×  

This system mirrors real-world long-term commitment.
