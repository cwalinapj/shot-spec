Node Types

Neural Network Launch Monitor  
• 23 TOPS or 26 TOPS accelerator  
• Stereo impact cameras  
• Optional front-facing flight camera  
• Microphone + speaker (Caddie AI)  
• Highest earning tier

Lite Node  
• Low-cost camera device  
• Attaches to golf cart or tripod  
• Captures DTL or face-on angles  
• Medium reward tier

Phone Node  
• Uses smartphone GPS and camera  
• Provides essential metadata  
• Lowest earning tier but critical for early adoption

Mining Earnings

Neural Node:
• Base multiplier highest  
• Stereo impact data yields maximum rewards  
• Acts as a compute contributor to certain model pipelines

Lite Node:
• Provides geometric context  
• Multiplies Neural Node earnings when used together  
• Ideal for cart-mounted setups

Phone Node:
• Provides score, lie, club, and GPS  
• Required for most rewards  
• Anti-cheat cornerstone

Data Types That Earn

• Impact data  
• Clubface geometry  
• Hand, arms, torso pose context  
• Ball launch direction (multi-angle)  
• Environmental metadata  
• Course geometry  
• Scorekeeping and shot attribution

Mining Without Hotspotting

Nodes connect to:

• Each other via Wi-Fi direct  
• The phone for uplink  
• The cloud in deferred batches

Phone retains mobile data; node traffic is local.

Future Expansion

• Multi-node mesh modes  
• Long-range Wi-Fi  
• Caddie AI streaming from device  
• Solar-powered range nodes
