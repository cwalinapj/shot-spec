ShotSpec Reward Pools and Multipliers  
Dynamic Emission Engine Based on Data Scarcity

Multipliers and pools ensure the right kind of golf data enters the network at the right time.

Daily Reward Pool Structure

The reward pool is divided across:

• Impact data  
• Club-attribution data  
• GPS + lie data  
• Multi-angle puts  
• Driving-range geometry  
• Environmental rarity  
• Player diversity  
• Course rarity

Each pool adjusts dynamically depending on:

• What data the model needs most  
• Geographic diversity  
• Course inclusion  
• Device density

Multipliers

Multipliers stack in the following categories:

Club-Based:
• Using a fully configured bag  
• Using rare shaft/grip combos  
• Using multiple balls with tagging data

Device-Based:
• Neural Node base multiplier  
• Lite Node addition  
• Dual-impact stereo  
• Phone DTL angle  
• Radar pairing (Mevo/Nova/etc.)

Environment-Based:
• Wind over 35 mph  
• Snowing  
• Temperature extremes  
• Night play (if allowed)

Course-Based:
• Rarely played courses  
• New course onboarding  
• Co-op partner courses

Stacking Rules

Multipliers are multiplicative unless flagged as “exclusive.”  
Exclusive examples:

• Genesis multipliers  
• Device-tier multipliers

---

Shot Value Formula (simplified)

Reward = Base × Device × Club × Angle × Environment × Course × Validation

---

Long-Term Goal

As the model matures:

• Multipliers decrease  
• Base reward decreases  
• Focus shifts from data acquisition → utility currency
