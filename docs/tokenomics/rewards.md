ShotSpec Rewards Engine  
How Users Earn CLUB Across Devices, Courses, and Data Types

The ShotSpec rewards system pays players, data contributors, and device operators for generating verifiable golf telemetry. The system is designed so that the network improves every day while early contributors benefit proportionally.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Reward Categories

Players and devices earn CLUB for:

• Verified golf shots  
• Valid golf rounds  
• Bag completion events  
• Impact video submissions  
• Multi-angle data (stereo + phone)  
• Rare environmental conditions (wind, rain, temperature extremes)  
• Course location rarity  
• Driving range validated shots  
• Device uptime for neural-network compute sharing  
• Approved Pi / Neural Node mining contributions  

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Reward Flow Summary

1. User plays golf or practices  
2. Device(s) capture telemetry  
3. Phone app provides GPS + lie + club attribution  
4. Cloud validates  
5. Anti-cheat engine approves  
6. Reward pool distributes CLUB  
7. Tokens enter “pending” state  
8. Tokens become “final” after validation window  

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Pending vs Final Rewards

Pending rewards protect the system from:

• spoofed GPS  
• reuse of old footage  
• mismatched timestamps  
• falsified swings  
• fraudulent club declarations  

Once validated, rewards permanently move to the user’s wallet (auto-staked if configured).

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Reward Pool Dynamics

The daily reward amount is dynamic:

• Based on number of shots the network still needs  
• Higher when the network is young  
• Declines as the model matures  
• Rises when new features require new datasets  

Rewards align with data scarcity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Early Incentives

Early contributors receive:

• Higher multipliers  
• Genesis bonuses  
• Exclusive NFTs with passive multipliers  
• Permanent “Founding Golfer” status inside the protocol  

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Long-Term Vision

When the neural network becomes world-class:

• CLUB becomes utility currency  
• Staking yields rise as supply decreases  
• Users earn tokens whenever they play  
• Caddie AI and Launch Monitor features cost CLUB unless staked
